## About

**Szamlazzhu-agent** is a Laravel package that provides an easy-to-use interface for communicating with the Sz치ml치zz.hu API. It was created by refactoring the original source code (available at [here](https://docs.szamlazz.hu/#php-api/)) and integrating it into the [Laravel framework](https://laravel.com/).

Many of the original source code files were reforged to use the built-in features of Laravel, such as HTTP client, Filesystem abstraction, Configuration and service provider. As a result, **Szamlazzhu-agent** provides a more streamlined and idiomatic way of interacting with the Sz치ml치zz.hu API.

            'root' => storage_path('app/payment'),
            'throw' => false,
            // `private` = 0600, `public` = 0700
            'visibility' => 'private',
            // `private` = 0700, `public` = 0755
            'directory_visibility' => 'private',
        ],
